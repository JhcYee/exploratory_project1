# exploratory_project1
This is a personal exploratory project meant to help me practice ML in Python transitioning from R. 
This project takes the historical data of the stock index "SPY" and performs data analysis.
I used a linear regression model based on the closing price, SMA50, and SMA200 to train and test the data.
This project is done using Numpy, Matplotlib, ScikitLearn, and Yahoo Finance.
